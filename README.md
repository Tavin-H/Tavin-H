## Hi there 👋
I'm Tavin Hartwood, a Computer Science student studying at Simon Fraser University in BC, Canada. 
I love the craft of code and take great pride in every line that I produce. 

### Current projects: 
- A compiler written in Rust for my own C-like programming language
- An 8-bit computer using ICs and breadboards

### 📖 Currently reading: 
- "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" - Harold Abelson,
